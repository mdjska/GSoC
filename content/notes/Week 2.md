#### What I managed:
- Finished the two mockups
- Got feedback on the mockups and discussed different approaches to implementing the Ifc schema, degree of abstraction and other.
- Researched the approaches of other tools like GeometryGym, Topologic, Homemaker and Ladybug Tools.
- Did some more tutorials on Sverchok and Blender BIM

It took a bit more time than expected to understand the concepts of this environment, but I'm ready to start coding next week.
