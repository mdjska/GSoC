#### What I managed:
#### 5/7
Read and explored blenderbim modules and how to create geometry in ifcopenshell. 
#### 18/7
Started working on blender mesh to ifc node.
Tried to understand blenderbims geometry module.
Found `ifcopenshell.api.geometry.add_representation` module and tried to run it with the existing api node, but couldn't figure out how to pass `*setting_values` . 
#### 30/7
Explored the blender python api, tried to ran different ifcopenshell.api modules in the blender text editor.
