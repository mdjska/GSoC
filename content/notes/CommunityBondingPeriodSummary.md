#### What I managed:
- Setup this static website and connected it to my PKM/note-taking system
- Setup development environment for IfcSverchok and BlenderBIM 
- Reading and trying to understand existing IfcSverchok code
- Getting familiar with Sverchok and creating sverchok nodes 
- Getting familiar with Blender itself
- Getting familiar with Blender Bim
- Tried to create a new, more detailed version of node mockups, but ran into limitations with my understanding of geometry data types in IFC. Started reading up on geometry in IFC, Opencascade and Blender.
